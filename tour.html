		<h1>An Illustrated Guide to Git on Windows</h1>

		<h2 id="about">About</h2>

		<p>This document is designed to show that using git on Windows
		is not a difficult process. In this guide, I will create a
		repository, make several commits, create a branch, merge a
		branch, search the commit history, push to a remote server, and
		pull from a remote server. The majority of this will be done
		using GUI tools.</p>

		<p>Although this guide is targeted for use on Windows, the git gui tool
		works the same on all platforms. Because of this, git users on other
		platforms may find useful information here as well.</p>

		<p>If you have any comments about this guide, feel free to <a
			href="mailto:nathanj@insightbb.com">contact me</a>.</p>

		<h2 id="putty">Downloading PuTTY</h2>

		<p>Although you can use the SSH program that comes with git, I
		prefer to use the PuTTY Agent to keep track of my SSH keys.  If
		you don't already have them, download <span
			class="tt">putty.exe</span>, <span
			class="tt">plink.exe</span>, <span
			class="tt">pageant.exe</span>, and
		<span class="tt">puttygen.exe</span> from the <a
			href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html">PuTTY
			web site</a>.</p>

		<p>Later in this guide, we will use these programs for securely
		pushing our changes to a remote server.</p>

		<h2 id="installing">Installing Git</h2>

		<p>First, download <a
			href="http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/downloads/list">msysgit</a>.
		This download is a single executable which installs the entire
		git system. While going through the installer, you will want to
		check the options to add Windows Explorer integration when you
		right click on a folder.</p>

		<p><img src="images/install.png" /></p>

		<p>Because we will be using PuTTY as our SSH client, choose
		<em>Use PLink</em> and fill in the path to the downloaded
		<span class="tt">plink.exe</span> executable.</p>

		<p><img src="images/26.png" /></p>

		<p>Continue clicking <em>Next</em> until the installation is
		complete.</p>

		<h2 id="creating">Creating a Repository</h2>

		<p><img src="images/01.png" /></p>

		<p>To create a repository, first create the folder you want the
		project to live under. Next, right click on the folder and
		choose <em>Git GUI Here</em>. Because there is no git repository
		in this folder yet, you will be presented with the git gui
		startup dialog.</p>

		<p><img src="images/02.png" /></p>

		<p>Choosing <em>Create New Repository</em> brings us to the next
		dialog.</p>

		<p><img src="images/03.png" /></p>

		<p>Fill in the path to your new directory and click Create. You
		will then be presented with the main interface of git gui, which
		is what will be shown from now on when you right click on your
		folder and click <em>Git GUI Here</em>.</p>

		<p><img src="images/04.png" /></p>

		<p>Now that the repository has been set up, you will need to tell
		git who you are so that commit messages will have the correct
		author. To do this, choose <i>Edit &rarr; Options</i>.</p>

		<p><img src="images/25.png" /></p>

		<p>In the options dialog, there are two versions of each
		preference. On the left side of the dialog are options that you
		want for this repository only, while the right side contains the
		global options which apply to all repositories. The defaults for
		these options are sensible so just fill in the user name and
		email for now. If you have a favorite font, you may want to set
		it now as well.</p>

		<h2 id="committing">Committing</h2>

		<p>Now that the repository has been created, it is time to
		create something to commit. For this example, I created a file
		called <span class="tt">main.c</span> with the following content:

		<pre>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
	printf("Hello world!\n");
	return 0;
}
</pre>

		<p>Clicking the <em>Rescan</em> button in the git gui will cause
		it to search out new, modified, and deleted files in the
		directory. In the next screenshot, git gui has found
		our new file (amazing, I know).</p>

		<p><img src="images/09.png" /></p>

		<p>To add the file for committing, click the icon to the left of
		the filename. The file will be moved from the <em>Unstaged
			Changes</em> pane to the <em>Staged Changes</em> pane. Now
		we can add a commit message and commit the change with the
		<em>Commit</em> button.</p>

		<p><img src="images/10.png" /></p>

		<p>Saying hello to the world is all well and good, but I would
		like my program to be more personal. Let's have it say hello to
		the user. Here's my code for that:</p>

		<pre>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
	char name[255];

	printf("Enter your name: ");
	fgets(name, 255, stdin);
	printf("length = %d\n", strlen(name)); /* debug line */
	name[strlen(name)-1] = '\0'; /* remove the newline at the end */

	printf("Hello %s!\n", name);
	return 0;
}
</pre>

		<p>I had some trouble figuring out why a newline was printed
		after the user's name, so I added a debugging line to help me
		track it down. I would like to commit this patch without the
		debug line, but I want to keep the line in my working copy to
		continue debugging. With git gui, this is no problem. First,
		click <em>Rescan</em> to scan for the modified file. Next,
		click the icon to the left of the filename to stage all
		modifications for commit. Then, right click on the debug
		line and chose <em>Unstage Line From Commit</em>.</p>

		<p><img src="images/11.png" /></p>

		<p>Now, the debug line has been unstaged, while the rest of the
		changes have been staged. From here, it is just a matter of
		filling in the commit message and clicking <em>Commit</em>.</p>

		<p><img src="images/12.png" /></p>

		<h2 id="branching">Branching</h2>

		<p>Now let's say that we want to start adding new features for
		our next big version of the program. But, we also want to keep a
		stable, maintenance version of the program to fix bugs on. To do
		this, we will create a branch for our new development.  To
		create a new branch in git gui, choose <i>Branch &rarr;
			Create</i>. The big feature that I would like to add is to
		ask the user for their last name, so I am calling this branch
		<span class="tt">lastname</span>. The default options in the
		Create Branch dialog are all fine, so just enter the name and
		click <em>Create</em>.</p>

		<p><img src="images/14.png" /></p>

		<p>Now that I am on the <span class="tt">lastname</span> branch,
		I can make my new modifications:</p>

		<pre>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
	char first[255], last[255];

	printf("Enter your first name: ");
	fgets(first, 255, stdin);
	first[strlen(first)-1] = '\0'; /* remove the newline at the end */

	printf("Now enter your last name: ");
	gets(last); /* buffer overflow? what's that? */

	printf("Hello %s %s!\n", first, last);
 	return 0;
}
</pre>

		<p>And then I can commit the change. Note here that I am
		committing using a different name. This is to show off something
		later. Normally you would always use the same name when
		committing.</p>

		<p><img src="images/15.png" /></p>

		<p>Meanwhile, a user informs us that not displaying a comma when
		directly addressing someone is a serious bug. In order to make
		this bug fix on our stable branch, we must first switch back to
		it. This is done using <i>Branch &rarr; Checkout</i>.

		<p><img src="images/16.png" /></p>

		<p>Now we can fix our major bug.</p>

		<p><img src="images/17.png" /></p>

		<p>If we choose <i>Repository &rarr; Visualize All Branch
			History</i>, we can see how our history is shaping up.</p>

		<p><img src="images/18.png" /></p>

		<h2 id="merging">Merging</h2>

		<p>After days of work, we decide that our <span
			class="tt">lastname</span>
		branch is stable enough to be merged into the <span
			class="tt">master</span>
		branch. To perform the merge, use <i>Merge &rarr; Local
			Merge</i>.</p>

		<p><img src="images/19.png" /></p>

		<p>Because the two different commits made two different
		modifications to the same line, a conflict occurs.</p>

		<p><img src="images/20.png" /></p>
		<p><img src="images/21.png" /></p>

		<p>This conflict can be resolved using any text editor.  After
		resolving the conflict, stage the changes by clicking the file
		icon and then commit the merge by clicking the <em>Commit</em>
		button.</p>

		<p><img src="images/22.png" /></p>

		<h2 id="history">Viewing History</h2>

		<p>The <span class="tt">main.c</span> file is starting to get a
		bit big, so I decided to move the user prompting portion of the
		code into its own function.  While I was at it, I decided to
		move the function into a separate file. The
		repository now contains the files <span
			class="tt">main.c</span>, <span class="tt">askname.c</span>,
		and <span class="tt">askname.h</span>.</p>

		<pre>
/* main.c */
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

#include "askname.h"

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
	char first[255], last[255];

	askname(first, last);

	printf("Hello, %s %s!\n", first, last);
 	return 0;
}
</pre>

		<pre>
/* askname.c */
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;

void askname(char *first, char *last)
{
	printf("Enter your first name: ");
	fgets(first, 255, stdin);
	first[strlen(first)-1] = '\0'; /* remove the newline at the end */

	printf("Now enter your last name: ");
	gets(last); /* buffer overflow? what's that? */
}
</pre>

		<pre>
/* askname.h */
void askname(char *first, char *last);
</pre>

		<p><img src="images/23.png" /></p>

		<p>The history of the repository can be viewed and searched by
		choosing <i>Repository &rarr; Visualize All Branch History</i>.
		In the next screenshot, I am trying to find which commit added
		the <span class="tt">last</span> variable by searching for all
		commits which added or removed the word <em>last</em>. Commits
		which match the search are bolded, making it quick and easy to
		spot the desired commit.</p>

		<p><img src="images/27.png" /></p>

		<p>A few days later, someone looks through our code and sees
		that the <span class="tt">gets</span> function could cause a
		buffer overflow.  Being the type to point fingers, this person
		decides to run a git blame to see who last modified this line of
		code. The problem is that Bob is the one who committed the line,
		but I was the one who last touched it when I moved the line into
		a different file.  Obviously, I am not to blame (of course). Is
		git smart enough to figure this out? Yes, it is.</p>
		
		<p>To run a blame, select <i>Repository &rarr; Browse master's
			Files</i>. From the tree that pops up, double click on the
		file with the line in question which in this case is <span
			class="tt">askname.c</span>.
		Hovering the mouse over the line in question shows a tooltip
		message that tells us all we need to know.</p>

		<p><img src="images/24.png" /></p>

		<p>Here we can see that the line was last modified by Bob in
		commit <span class="tt">f6c0</span>, and then I moved it to its
		new location in commit <span class="tt">b312</span>.

		<h2 id="pushing">Pushing to a Remote Server</h2>

		<p>Before pushing to a remote server, you must first create a
		SSH public and private key pair. By using SSH, you will be able
		to securely authenticate to the server that you are who you say
		you are. Creating the key pair is a simple process. Begin by
		running the <span class="tt">puttygen.exe</span> program
		downloaded earlier.  Next, click the <em>Generate</em> button to
		generate the keys.  After processing for a few seconds, click
		the <em>Save private key</em> button to save your new private
		key. Copy the public key to the clipboard in preparation for the
		next step. I would recommend not clicking the <em>Save public
			key</em> button because the saved file is in a non-standard
		format; trying to use it with other software might be
		problematic.</p>

		<p><img src="images/32.png" /></p>

		<p>Now that the keys are generated, the remote servers need to
		know about it. If you would like to use <a
			href="http://github.com/">github</a> to host your code, just
		go to your account page and paste in the public key.</p>

		<p><img src="images/33.png" /></p>

		<p>Now github has our public key, but we do not yet have
		github's. To remedy this, launch <span
			class="tt">putty.exe</span>, connect to <span
			class="tt">github.com</span>, and click <em>Yes</em> to
		accept github's public key. You can safely close the login
		window that opens up after accepting the key.

		<p><img src="images/34.png" /></p>

		<p><img src="images/35.png" /></p>

		<p>We need our private key to be loaded up to use with our
		public key, so launch <span class="tt">pageant.exe</span>. This
		program will create an icon in your system tray. Double clicking
		on the icon will open up a window into which the private key can
		be added. Once the private key is added, the agent will sit in
		the background and provide authentication when needed.</p>

		<p><img src="images/36.png" /></p>

		<p>Now that our client and server can authenticate each other,
		it is time to push! <i>Remote &rarr; Push</i> will open up
		the push dialog. Typing in the commit address for the project
		and clicking <em>Push</em> will send the changes on their way.</p>

		<p><img src="images/37.png" /></p>

		<p><img src="images/38.png" /></p>

		<p>Of course, typing in the remote url would become quite
		annoying if we had to do it with every push. Instead, git allows
		us to alias the long urls using remotes. Git gui currently does
		not have a way to add a remote, so the command line must be
		used. Right click on the repository folder and choose <i>Git Bash Here</i>.
		In the prompt, enter the following command:</p>

		<pre>
git remote add github git@github.com:nathanj/example.git
</pre>

		<p>Note: After adding a remote, close and reopen git gui for it to recognize
		the new remote.</p>

		<p>Now the remote <span class="tt">github</span> is aliased to
		the url <span
			class="tt">git@github.com:nathanj/example.git</span>. When
		viewing the push dialog in git gui, a convenient drop down list
		of remotes is shown.</p>

		<p><img src="images/39.png" /></p>

		<h2 id="pulling">Pulling from a Remote Server</h2>

		<p>Because our code is so useful, dozens of people have
		downloaded and now use our program. One person in particular,
		Fred, has decided to fork our project and add his own commits.
		Now that he's added his code, he would like us to pull those
		commits from him into our repository. To do this, first create
		another remote.</p>

		<pre>
git remote add fred ssh://fred@192.168.2.67/home/fred/example
</pre>

		<p>Now we can fetch Fred's changes using <i>Remote &rarr; Fetch
			from &rarr; fred</i>.

		<p><img src="images/40.png" /></p>

		<p>After the fetch, Fred's commits have now been added to our
		local repository under the <span
			class="tt">remotes/fred/master</span> branch. We can use
		gitk to visualize the changes that Fred has made.</p>

		<p><img src="images/41.png" /></p>

		<p>If we like all of Fred's changes, we could do a normal merge
		as before. In this case though, I like one of his commits but
		not the other. To only merge one of his commits, right click on
		the commit and choose <i>Cherry-pick this commit</i>. The
		commit will then be merged into the current branch.</p>

		<p><img src="images/42.png" /></p>
		<p><img src="images/43.png" /></p>

		<p>We can now push a final time to send Fred's patch to our
		github tree for everyone to see and use.</p>

		<p><img src="images/45.png" /></p>

		<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

		<p>In this guide, I have shown how to do many common tasks in
		git using GUI tools. I hope that this guide has shown that it is
		not only possible but easy to use git on Windows without having
		to use the Windows shell for most operations.</p>
